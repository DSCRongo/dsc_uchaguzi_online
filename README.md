## Contributor expectations
Contribution guidelines for fixing bugs or assist in project development.

1. Create a new git branch using command
    ```(bash)
    
     $ git checkout -b <name-of-your-branch
    
     ```
    **NOTE:** To avoid merging conflicts, please check that the name of your branch does not exist in this GitHub repo. For example, if you wish to create a branch named `feature` confirm that the name of the branch does not exist.
2. For the changes you make, you can push to your branch. For example, if I have created branch `feature`, I will push my changes to GitHub using the command
   
   ```(bash)
   
   $ git push -u origin <name-of-your-branch>
   
   ```
   
   In this case the `<name-of-your-branch>` will be `feature`.
   
3. Your changes will be pushed to GitHub. You can create a pull request after pushing your code and changes.
